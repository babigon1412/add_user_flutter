Add User To System

This project is an app for adding users to the system using a form. There are 2 positions to choose 1st is 'Leader' and 2nd is 'Normal'. In the first page, when opening the app, you will see a preview list of users, you can click to see all the lists of each group by pressing the 'see all' button and you can click to see the details of each person as well.

Thank you.
